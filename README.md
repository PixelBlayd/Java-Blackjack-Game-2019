# Java-Blackjack-Game-2019
These are the Initial Requirements for the project.
Each requirement must have a a key code for testing legibility and will be used as followed: 
REQ(number)

REQ1: The human Players starts first.

REQ2: At start, the Player automatically receives 2 random numbers between 1-10.

REQ3: The 2 random numbers are summed up.

REQ4: The Player can then choose to "Stick" or "hit".

REQ5: The Player can input any case for either answer.

REQ6: If the Player chooses to "Hit" again, another random number between 1-10 are added to the previous sum.

REQ7: If the Player chooses to "Stick" , it’s the computer’s turn.

REQ8: If the Computer's sum is lower than the Player, it will always "Hit".

REQ9: The closest to 21 without going over is the winner.

REQ10: The Player must be able to see the outcome of the match before finishing the application.

For the sake of simplicity, the value "1" DOES NOT have the option to become "11" based on certain circumstances.
